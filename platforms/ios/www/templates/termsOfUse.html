        <p id="termsOfUse-markdown5" style="color:#000000;" class=" ">
          When creating a Joinly Account you must provide access

          credentials either in the form of an email address, phone

        <p id="termsOfUse-markdown5" style="color:#000000;" class=" ">
          We may also collect personal data, where lawful to do so,
          from public sources and third party service providers.

        <h3 id="termsOfUse-heading7" style="color:#000000;" class=" ">Data Collected Automatically</h3>
        <p id="termsOfUse-markdown5" style="color:#000000;" class=" ">
          Certain technical information may be collected

          automatically as a standard part of your use of the Joinly

          Platform and this information may in certain circumstances

          constitute personal data.

          Automatically collected data may include:

          • Our servers automatically record information (“Log

          Data“). The logging technology used in the Joinly

          Platform automatically collects the URL of the site

          from which you came and the site to which you are

          going when you leave the Joinly Platform. We also

          collect the Internet protocol (IP) address of the device

          you use to access the Joinly Platform, information

          about the operating system of your device, as well as

          the name of your Internet service provider, browser

          type, the referring web page, pages visited, location,

          your mobile carrier, device and application IDs,

          search terms, and cookie information. We receive

          Log Data when you interact with our Joinly Platform,

          for example, when you visit our website, sign into our

          Joinly Platform, or interact with our email

          notifications. Joinly uses Log Data to provide our

          Joinly Platform and to measure, customize, and

          improve them. We will either delete Log Data or

          remove any common account identifiers, such as

          your username, full IP address, or email address,

          within or after 18 months.

          • In addition to server collected log data, Joinly uses

          analytics software to track and report user behavior

          anonymously through user log information. This data

          provides us additional information needed to evaluate

          how our service is used in order to improve our

          services. This report does not include personally

          identifiable data. The software has access to this

          data to process the information earlier stated on

          behalf of Joinly.

          • Cookies are text files that are saved on the hard drive of

          your device by means of your browser, enabling us to

          recognize your browser. Joinly may use both session

          cookies and persistent cookies to better understand

          how you interact with our Joinly Platform, to monitor

          aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing

          on our Joinly Platform, and to customize and improve

          our Joinly Platform. We may place a cookie on the

          hard drive of the device that you use to access the

          Joinly Platform. Most of the currently available

          browsers give you the option of managing cookies

          by, for example, disabling them entirely, accepting

          them individually, and deleting saved cookies from

          your hard drive. We do not require cookies for many

          parts of our Joinly Platform such as viewing public

          videos, but we would like to remind you that if you

          completely disable cookies on your browser, you

          might not be able to use some features of the Joinly

          Platform.

          • We may keep track of how you interact with links across

          our Joinly Platform, including our email notifications,

          third-party services, and client applications, by

          redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this

          to help improve our Joinly Platform, for example to

          provide relevant advertising, and to be able to share

          aggregate click statistics such as how many times a

          particular link was clicked on.

          Moreover, details of transactions you carry out through the

          Joinly Platform, and details of your visits to the Joinly

          Platform including, but not limited to, traffic data and other

          communication data may also be collected.
